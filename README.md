# Dagger Universe Library

This repository is a collection of Dagger standard library packages.

## How it's used in Dagger

With every release of Dagger we specify a version of stdlib. Using our package manager stdlib is pulled on `dagger init`
and can be updated using `dagger mod get`.

## Versioning
